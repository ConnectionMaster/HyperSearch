		* Backspace or Escape to go back to previous screen. 
		* You can press CTRL+ENTER on the keyboard screen to start searching
		* ALT+F4 to close the HyperSearch window at any time

		* [Exit] to go back to the previous screen or close the window
		* [Up] and [Down] to navigate on result set
		* You can press CTRL+[Start] on the keyboard screen to start searching
